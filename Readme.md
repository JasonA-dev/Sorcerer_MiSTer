# Exidy Sorcerer core for MiSTer

This is the MiSTer core of the Exidy Sorcerer computer.

- Thanks to gyurco for the original MiST core, on which this was ported

## Usage
You might need to load BASIC using the BIN OSD option.

UART should be wired correctly, so you should be able to load tapes using that. Untested.
